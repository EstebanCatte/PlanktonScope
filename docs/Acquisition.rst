Raspbian installation
=====================

If you are using the `Raspbian`_ distro, it is best to install picamera using
the system's package manager: apt. This will ensure that picamera is easy to
keep up to date, and easy to remove should you wish to do so. It will also make
picamera available for all users on the system. To install picamera using apt
simply::
  start()

  while True: 
      init()
      load()
      flush()
      image()
      aeration()
      wait()

  stop()
